For CBU, there is a superficial distinction between a discussion and an update.
For all intensive purposes, one is simply considered public and one considered private.

The data structure is the same, and the way they act is the same, but for CBU
we decided to seporate it into a discussions api and an updates api to avoid
confusion.  This is why there are the files api_discussions and api_updates, 
even though they just call helper funcs.
