For CBU, there is a superficial distinction between a a project and a resource.

Conceptually a project is something that a user joins and partakes, while a resource is something provided by a city and people only follow.  The only real differences are

project you join
resource you follow

resources do not allow discussions (only updates)

because these two are so similar, for CBU we are adding a 
resource boolean, and opeing a seporate api for resources.
