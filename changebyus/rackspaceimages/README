Handles the local uploading of images.
This image is then uploaded to the rackspace container.

If an image is requested, we first attempt to redirect to
rackspace, if that fails we will redirect locally, which may
generate a 404.

This can easily be integrated with flask-cdn allowing for
url_for('static', 'photo.jpg') which will redirect to photo.jpg
in the rackspace container that is configured
